      <h1>Policy - Animal Welfare</h1>

      <p>The fair treatment of animals is important to the BNP. The BNP believe a civilisation can be judged on how it treats animals.</p>
      <p><b>The BNP will:</b></p>
      <ul>
      <li>Ban the inhumane ritual slaughter of animals on religious grounds</li>
      <li>Ban the export of live animals for slaughter</li>
      <li>Triple the maximum jail sentence for animal cruelty</li>
      <li>Extend the re-population programme of Red Squirrels, already successfully trialled in Scotland, to include the entire British Isles</li>
      <li>Hold a fresh debate on the culling of badgers â€“ far greater scrutiny of the data which warrants this cull as a measure to prevent the spread of TB must be undertaken</li>
      <li>Continue to oppose the horrific EU policy of slaughtering seals for eating fish in the North Sea because the EU have allowed fish stocks to be decimated by over-fishing</li>
      <li>Host a sensible and mature discussion on fox hunting to ensure that not only foxes are protected, but the identity and traditions of rural communities too</li>
      </ul>
