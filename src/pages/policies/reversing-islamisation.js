      <h1>Policy - Islamisation</h1>

      <p><strong>The BNP is implacably opposed to the Labour/Tory regimes’ Mass Immigration policy which, if left unchecked, will see Britain and most of Europe colonised by Islam within a few decades.</strong></p>
      <p>The BNP recognises that Islam, by its very nature, is incompatible with modern secular Western democracy.</p>
      <p>The BNP will protect our identity and heritage because it is the cornerstone of our culture and freedom.</p>
      <p><strong>The BNP will:</strong></p>
      <ul>
      <li>Revoke citizenship for anyone who gives aid and comfort to enemies of Britain</li>
      <li>Refuse permission for any further mosques – including conversion or new build – because Britain has enough for its Muslim population</li>
      <li>Deny permission for any more mosques and minarets – which are little more than symbols of territorial conquest</li>
      <li>Ban the burqa and niqab</li>
      <li>Closer monitoring of teaching practises and curriculums in schools</li>
      <li>Negotiate peace treaties with Muslim nations, withdraw British troops from Muslim lands and refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of Islamic nations</li>
      <li>Defend our traditional Christian faith</li>
      <li>Ban Sharia law</li>
      <li>Ensure that existing community buildings such as pubs and churches are not turned into mosques</li>
      </ul>
