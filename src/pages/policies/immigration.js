        <p><strong>At the core of British National Party policy is the belief that Immigration into Britain is a destructive agenda and must be stopped.</strong></p>
        <p>Without any vote or debate, successive governments in Britain have introduced the most pernicious and divisive policy since World War II, and transformed our country almost beyond recognition.</p>
        <p>In towns and cities up and down the country we feel like foreigners in our own country, our traditions derided and our future given away.</p>
        <p>The nation&#8217;s population is now well over 60 million and rising rapidly solely due to Immigration. The influx of migrants is adding to continual pressure on the housing, the NHS, GP waiting lists, school places, and saturating the lower skilled markets and undercutting British workers.</p>
        <p>Immigration has resulted in ghettos in many towns adding to the threat of Islamisation and breeding home grown terrorism by having introduced a fifth-column of Islamists.</p>
        <p>Even the most obsessive proponents of Multiculturalism have been forced to admit its disastrous failure.</p>
        <p>It&#8217;s no wonder then, that more than 85% of the British public agree with the BNP that Immigration is too high.</p>
        <p>Immigration is the greatest threat to our precious and unique British identity.</p>
        <p>The BNP is the ONLY political party you can trust to stop Immigration. Britain’s full and it’s time to shut the door!</p>
        <p>The current open-door policy and unrestricted, uncontrolled immigration is leading to higher crime rates, demand for more housing (driving prices out of the reach of young people), severe extra strain on the environment, traffic congestion, longer hospital waiting lists, lower educational standards, higher income taxes, lower wages, higher unemployment, loss of British identity, a breakdown in community spirit, more restrictive policing, higher council taxes, a shortage of council homes, higher levels of stress and unhappiness and a more atomised society.</p>
        <p>The pressure on housing and on public services such as schools, hospitals, transport networks, welfare and social security is far too great.</p>
        <p><strong>We will:</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Introduce a National Security Moratorium, stopping all further immigration into Britain until we can sort out the politicians’ Immigration shambles and deport the two million+ here illegally</li>
        <li>Prosecute Islamist Hate Preachers and deport them</li>
        <li>Leave the EU and take back control of our borders</li>
        <li>Deport bogus asylum seekers and foreign criminals immediately</li>
        <li>Offer generous grants to those of foreign descent who are resident here and who wish to leave permanently</li>
        <li>No amnesty for illegal immigrants</li>
        <li>Crack down on sham marriages</li>
        <li>Reject all asylum seekers who passed safe countries on their way to Britain.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Immigration is out of control. Britain’s population is now over 60 million and rising, solely due to immigration. Not only is Britain increasingly overcrowded, but the fact is that a country is the product of its people and if you change the people you inevitably change the nature of the country.</p>
        <p>We want Britain to remain – or return to – the way it has traditionally been. We accept that Britain always will have ethnic minorities and have no problem with this as long as they remain minorities and do not change nor seek to change the fundamental culture and identity of the indigenous peoples of the British Isles.</p>
        <p>India would not tolerate millions of non-Indians taking over that society. Pakistan would not tolerate millions of Hindus or Christians entering that country and changing it from a Muslim society into something else. Japan would not do it; China would not do it &#8211; so why should Britain?</p>
        <p>Can anyone imagine Saudi Arabia allowing the mass immigration of Christians, so that in a few decades it would no longer be an Islamic country?</p>
        <p>Each nation has the right to maintain its own identity. The right of India to remain Indian, the right of China to remain Chinese, the right of Pakistan to remain Pakistani and the right of Saudi Arabia to remain Saudi does not mean that any of these nations “hate” anybody else.</p>
        <p>All it means is that they wish to preserve their identity and national existence.</p>
        <p>This is all the British National Party seeks for Britain &#8211; the right to be British.</p>
        <p>This is not an extreme demand &#8211; it is actually just perfectly normal and completely in line with the rights granted to every other nation and with international law.</p>
        <p>All the other parties shy away from this issue, because they are the ones who have caused the problem in the first place.</p>
        <p>Only the British National Party has the reasonable, sensible, fair and just immigration policy which will guarantee that Britain remains British.</p>
