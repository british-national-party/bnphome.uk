      <h1>Policy - Senior Citizens</h1>

      <p>People who have paid in all their lives deserve to be well treated in retirement.</p>
      <p>It is important to introduce measures to relieve the pressures of an aging population.</p>
      <p><b>The BNP will:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>End the scandal of elderly people being forced to sell their homes to afford nursing care</li>
        <li>Encourage active pensioners to continue working beyond retirement age, on favourable tax terms</li>
        <li>Raise the guaranteed state pension to £150 per week and restore the link to average wages</li>
        <li>Reduce the current annual allowance for tax relief on pension contributions to £100,000, benefiting those who manage to save the least</li>
        <li>Combine health and social care and bring both under the authority of the NHS</li>
      </ul>
